## **Herbevic/SME ( sur_myevic )**

#### [Документация на русском](https://github.com/MicroSur/sur_myevic/blob/master/README_ru.md)

SME is a fork of myevic Custom Firmware from [ClockSelect](https://github.com/ClockSelect/myevic/blob/master/src)

#### Based on:
*Original VTC Mini 3.03 firmware*

#### Main Features:
The look-and-feel of the myevic firmware is more-or-less identical to the original firmware, so you shouldn't be lost.  
All new features and options are made available through the **menu system**.

A list of some differences from the original firmware (google translate)  

 * allowable resistance from **0.05** Ohm in all modes.
 * **Repeat** mode (replay) - simple replacement of the thermal control operation in the Power mode.
* **Profiles** to save different settings and quickly apply them.
* more configurable window-change timeouts.
* heating curves, **smart preheating** in Power, various heating algorithms in thermal control.
* the reaction time for a combination of buttons is shortened.
* there is no automatic power-down with a weak battery charge. It's honest.
* **Varivolt** mode, when the voltage does not change during the soaring.
* safety: stop fire, and then turn off the mode, if the fire button is pressed longer than the set hover cutoff.
* USB charge disconnection during overtemperature (for 2+ battery modes).
* **automatic shutdown** mode after reaching the user specified number of puffs or the operating time of the mod.
* in the information line, you can choose to display a set of **important information**, not just puffs and amps.
* in the first interface of the screen an additional information line is added, for greater clarity.
* the second screen mode, where the power and resistance lines are shown in large font.
* a short-time display of clocks in the off mode.
* turn off/on the charging screen of the mod by the minus button. Timeouts of the charging screen display.
* setting **maximum values** power, voltage, temperature, charging current (for 2+ battery modes), number of batteries for bypass.
* adjust the screen flip during tightening.
* smart **screen inversion**, does not show empty white screens.
* **correction** of the board temperature and determination of the resistance of the atomizer.
* more accurate display of resistance in idle time to the third sign.
* edit **your battery profile** from the mod menu.
* **Reset resistance** to the real current, without twisting the atomizer.
* setting the initial temperature of the resistance blocking for the thermal control mode, not only 20 degrees.
* selection for graphical display of all 1-2-3-4 batteries, percentage and voltage to choose from.
* **Autofire**. Hover with the specified tightening time without constant holding down the Start button. Infinite autofire.
* reset all counters at once; reset resetting counters if a fresh battery is inserted, or the battery is charged in box-fashion itself.
* counters of evaporated liquid and expended energy. The counter evaporated per day is reset automatically at midnight. Set the reset at midnight to other counters.
* a lot of options for animation **3D screensavers**. Support for logos 64x40, 64x48.
* press plus button for information why mod is in off state.
* games Tetris and Flappy Bird for fun.
